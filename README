This R package provides some algorithms for actigraphic sleep recognition. Specifically, you can either apply pre-trained algorithms (that were trained by supervised training, using data from 20 patients for which PSG scorings are available) or train and evaluate the algorithms with your own data, using k-fold or leave-one-patient-out cross validation. 

To install the package, just do the following (in R, assuming that the package .tar.gz file is in current working directory):

install.packages(c('dplyr', 'ggplot2', 'signal', 'entropy', 'e1071', 'data.table', 'fasttime', 'plyr', 'reshape2', 'MASS', 'mhsmm', 'mvtnorm'))
install.packages("sleeprec_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")

In R load the package with "library(sleeprec)", and run "vignette("sleeprec-tutorial")" to get a manual of this package.
