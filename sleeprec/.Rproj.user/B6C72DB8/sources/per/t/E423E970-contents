# use a pre-trained algorithm for classification. For this, we need to specify
#the algorithm (c("logreg","sadeh","lda","cole","hmm")) and feature (see colnames(features))
#for example:
feature = "amean_f"
alg = "hmm"

pretrainedClassification = applyPretrained(alg,feature,features)


#train and test using leave-one-subject-out cv (either getting the actual classification back, or the cross validation result)
classification = doClassification(features)
result = doCV(features)
